# PSWHost 

Powershell Windows Presentation Framework Host

## Description 

PSWHost is a PowerShell Host that displays output and reads input from a custom Windows Presentation Framework (WPF/XAML) Window.
This project is based on another PowerShell host at http://PS2Wiz.CodePlex.com project. 

Any output sent from PowerShell to the Host will be translated into Windows Presentation Framework (WPF).
Additionally you can add your own XAML WPF code directly to the WPF Application.

Want to try it out? 
Run the "BuildAll.ps1" script to compile the samples and see how things work.
